 Learning about Markov Chains again, hopefully making an API to go with it.

 * original_text.txt is unsanitized.
 * base_text.txt is sanitized - removed extra spaces, new lines, special-characters, changed encoding to utf-8.
 * base_text.txt created with notepad++ using built-in tools.
 * base_text.txt is used to populate the starting dictionary.
 * mc.json stores the Markov Chain dictionary.
